Hello!

Below you can find a outline of how to reproduce my 4th place solution for the Microsoft Malware Prediction Challenge competition.


# CONTENTS  
Directories and Files:  
data/ - The directory will store the raw competition data, along with another folder for the processed data  
data/clean/ - The processed data used for the final submission  
logs/ - The training logs, and feature importances of the models  
models/ - The 5 LightGBM models that were used to produce the submission  
submissions/ - The final submission.csv file  
predict.py - Used to make model predictions, uses data from data/clean/ and the models in models/ , stores predictions in submissions/    
prepare_data.py - Processes the raw data and saves it in data/clean  
SETTINGS.json - Paths to all directories and file locations references in the code . 
train.py - Trains the models, uses data from data/clean/, saves training logs and feature importances in logs/, saves model in models/   




# Hardware: (The following specs were used to create the original solution)   
1. AWS c4.8xlarge (36 vCPUs, 60 GB memory)  
2. Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (100 GB boot disk)  

# Software (python packages are detailed separately in `requirements.txt`)  
Python 3.7.1  

# Data setup 
The following code will download the raw train and test files from the competition. Assumes Kaggle API is installed.  
```
cd data
kaggle competitions download microsoft-malware-prediction -f test.csv
kaggle competitions download microsoft-malware-prediction -f train.csv
```
# Process the data
The following code will process the raw competition data stored in the data/ directory, and save the processed data in the data/clean/ directory. (NOTE: Running this code will overwrite the files data/clean/test-clean.pkl and data/clean/train.pkl.)    
`python prepare_data.py`


# Model training    
The following code will retrain the models. It will use data in the data/clean/train-clean.pkl file. This will take over 9 hours to train (NOTE: This will overwrite all files in logs/ and models/)   
`python train.py`  

# Model prediction:  
The following code will use the data/clean/test-clean.pkl data to produce a new submission file. This will take about 15 minutes. (NOTE: this will overwrite the submissions/submission.csv file.)  
`python predict.py`
